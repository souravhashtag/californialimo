       Along the steep hillsides and high elevation vineyards of Howell Mountain, you will experience intensely flavorful wines (distinctive from the valley floor) during your private wine tasting tour with California Limo Wine Tours. Situated above the fog, the vineyards are bathed in sunlight and provide spectacular views of the valley below.
       Howell Mountain holds the distinction of the first American Viticultural Area (AVA) in greater Napa Valley and is known for producing intense wines from small grape clusters. While once known for robust Zinfandels, Howell Mountain has been transformed over several decades by growers seeking dark, rich flavors for Merlot and, of course, big Cabernets. These wines are known for big tannins, velvety texture, and often a unique hint of white pepper.
