       Traveling through the beautiful and intimate hillside terrain of Spring Mountain is a private wine tasting tour our customers adore. Spring Mountain District is just a few minutes off highway 29, behind the town of Saint Helena. Small vineyards meander through this region. There are two-dozen family-owned and operated Napa wineries and 1,000 acres of vineyards. Visitors are often greeted by the owner of the winery, a family member, or even the winemaker. Visits must be arranged in advance.
